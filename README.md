# Anosh Fallah — Portfolio (Light theme, GitHub Pages ready)

This is a static React + TypeScript portfolio with a light, modern tech-professional theme.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Resume behavior

- `public/resume.pdf` contains your resume.
- Navigating to `/resume/` loads the PDF via `public/resume/index.html`.

Note: On GitHub Pages with HashRouter, your app routes look like `/#/work`, but `/resume/` is a real static path (no hash).

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1) Push to a GitHub repo (branch `main`)
2) GitHub → Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions
3) Push a commit to trigger deployment

The workflow is in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
